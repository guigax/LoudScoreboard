# Loud Scoreboard

This app was born from the necessity of a scoreboard app that announced the score using the
text-to-speech function, the ones that I have found with similar function did not get the focus for
the audio (like when there is music playing).

One thing that also distinguish it from other apps is that it shows on the lock screen, so if you
want to pass your cellphone to another person to mark down the score, you can lock your phone.
