# Loud Scoreboard

This app was born from the necessity of a scoreboard app that announced the score using the
text-to-speech function, the ones that I have found with similar function did not get the focus for
the audio (like when there is music playing).

## Features

- [x] Show score
- [x] Add and subtract from score
- [x] Reset button
- [x] Swap button
- [x] Whistle button
- [x] Points announcement
- [x] Teams announcement
- [x] Settings screen (WIP)

## TODO

- [ ] Improve changing the name of the teams
- [ ] Change background colors
- [ ] Change announce order
- [ ] Change points increment number
- [ ] Change app logo
- [ ] Add option to mute the app
- [ ] Add other sounds to replace the whistle
- [ ] Add points limiter
- [ ] Translation
